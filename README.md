# Python Data Analysis and Visualization Course

Welcome to the **Python Data Analysis and Visualization** course! This project will guide you through essential topics in data analysis and visualization using libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **Intro/**: Start here! This folder contains the introduction to the course and foundational materials you need to understand before diving into specific libraries.
- **pandas/**: This section covers the `pandas` library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis. You'll learn how to work with DataFrames, perform operations, and manipulate datasets.
- **Seaborn and pyplot/**: This section covers data visualization using `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`. You'll learn how to create bar charts, visualize data distributions, and customize plots.
- **Data/**: This folder contains datasets that will be used throughout the course. Ensure this folder is intact to run the exercises.
- **Done Project/**: This folder includes the last task of the project. Here we do the analysis for project. 
- **course-info.yaml**: Metadata about the course.
- **project.png**: An image related to the course (our target).
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the project as a package.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Project:**
   - If you're working from GitHub, you can clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the project as a zip file and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
     ```

3. **Start with the Intro:**
   - Navigate to the `Intro/` folder and start with the introductory materials.
   - Follow the instructions and complete exercises in each section before moving on to the next.

4. **Work on the `pandas` Section:**
   - Once you've completed the introduction, move on to the `pandas/` folder to explore data analysis using `pandas`.
   - Open the exercises and start writing your code!

5. **Visualize Data:**
   - After learning `pandas`, proceed to the `Seaborn and pyplot/` folder to learn data visualization techniques.
   - Practice creating visualizations with the provided datasets.

6. **Do final Project**
   - Do the visualization and analysis of the given data in order to complete the plotting, so that it looks like our target plot.

7. **Compare Your Work:**
   - If you get stuck or want to compare your results, refer to the peek function of PyCharm, where you’ll find completed versions of the exercises.

## Additional Information

- **Data Folder**: Make sure to explore the datasets in the `Data/` folder. They are used for exercises across the course.
- **Course Metadata**: The `course-info.yaml` file contains metadata about the course for your reference.
- **Project Image**: The `project.png` file may serve as a visual guide.

## Learning Workflow

1. **Read the Theories First**: Always start by reading the theory files located in the respective sections.
2. **Complete the Exercises**: After understanding the theory, proceed to complete the exercises provided in each folder.
3. **Peek at the Solution**: If you’re stuck, refer to the peek feature to see how the problem was solved.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Python installed on your system.
- Familiarity with using Python packages (installation via pip).

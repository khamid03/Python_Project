## Now we shall start getting ready for our project of creating this table: ![](project.png)

## Here is the code for you so we can end this project by working together, there are parts which you shall fill with your code and some parts are done. 

## Here are our steps of implementing this barplotting:
1. Import libraries as we learned
2. Read data from `'dataset.csv'`
3. Create DataFrame with counted values regarding `platform` and `genre`
4. Reset indexes and rename 0 column as 'count'
5. Sort each platform's genre separately for alphabetic way
6. Concatenate previous 4 sorted DataFrames
7. Set style 'darkgrid' for plotting
8. Barplot our data with data,x,y,hue as 'genre' and saturation as 0.9
9. Change style to 'whitegrid' then put legend with title 'genre' and without frame
10. Move legend out and get figure
11. Lastly, Save figure as "project_done.png" with tight bbox and resolution(quality) set to 300

### This Project is also the one you will be checking yourself and after doing it correctly, you can also add some new parts or new codes to play.
